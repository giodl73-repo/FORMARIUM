# Factorium Product Plan

## Product thesis

Factorium will be a lasting reference collection of decomposition patterns.
Its books and Factor Tables help people discover dimensions, distinguish
senses, compare pivots, assign factor roles to available mechanisms, and avoid
invalid or unstable structures. Formula Tables extend the same reference form
to major sourced mathematical relations without losing units, dimensions,
scope, or assumptions.

Software, experiments, and evidence exist to construct and improve the
reference. They are not the top-level product.

## Product identity

- Name: **Factorium**
- Reference unit: **Factor Table**
- Specialized mathematical unit: **Formula Table**
- Narrowed output: **Factor Guide**
- Supporting software: **Factorium Workbench**
- Founding research method: **Factor-Preserving Semantic Encoding**
- Repo type: encyclopedia/reference project with supporting research and tools

## Principles

1. Books and Factor Tables are the primary deliverable.
2. Separate different senses from competing factorizations of one sense.
3. Present credible alternatives instead of one unexplained canonical answer.
4. Make pivots, dependencies, constraints, and failure signs explicit.
5. Define general factor roles before mapping them into particular paradigms.
6. Prefer lists and tables; use only enough exposition to prevent misuse.
7. Preserve provenance, maturity, counterexamples, and disputed analyses.
8. Keep software auxiliary and make AI suggestions reviewable.
9. Preserve null results and the founding research evidence.
10. Keep mathematical equality distinct from semantic decomposition.

## Waves

### Wave 1: Method foundation

Define the terminology, schema contract, benchmark protocol, controls, and
first reproducible reference corpus.

### Wave 2: Role and ambiguity

Test role/filler binding, repeated factor values, ambiguity, and alternative
surface forms against feature structures and vector-symbolic controls.

Sequence:

1. research and role-reviewed plan;
2. analysis-set and role-frame contract;
3. generated role and ambiguity fixtures;
4. exact TPR, structured, factored, and bounded HRR controls;
5. role/ambiguity bakeoff;
6. portable Wave 2 packet.

### Wave 3: Factorium reference foundation

Define the grand vision, Factor Table grammar, general factor-role vocabulary,
cross-paradigm mappings, pilot entries, and Factor Guide method.

Provisional scale: 25–50 pilot entries, about 250 entries for the first
substantial volume, about 1,000 canonical headwords for the core reference,
and 3,000–5,000 only after mature editorial validation.

### Wave 4: First Factorium volume

Assemble and usability-test a coherent table-first reference across several
domains.

### Wave 5: Factorium Workbench

Add search, construction, comparison, narrowing, and publishing software only
after the editorial method is stable.

### Wave 6: Reference expansion

Grow reviewed volumes, contributors, provenance, and cross-references without
losing canonical entry identity.

## Founding research pulses

1. Workspace foundation.
2. Semantic-factor schema contract.
3. Prior art and benchmark custody.
4. Schema parser and conformance.
5. Compositional split fixtures.
6. Alias and strong-control bakeoff.
7. Portable result packet and onboarding guide.

## Non-goals

- replacing the books with a chat interface or generated prose;
- claiming one universal ontology or decomposition;
- publishing large unreviewed lists of plausible AI suggestions;
- forcing every domain into OO, Rust, or another favored paradigm;
- broad NLP, reasoning, or language-understanding claims from toy corpora;
- Squarebit-specific hardware or performance claims;
- arbitrary whole-symbol baselines presented as state of the art;
- outcome-selected splits, dimensions, or metrics;
- production framework scope before the method contract stabilizes.

## Validation

```powershell
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
cargo run --quiet -- check fixtures\schemas\navigation.factor
cargo run --quiet -- fixtures
cargo run --quiet -- role-fixtures
cargo run --quiet -- binding-controls
cargo run --quiet -- role-bakeoff
cargo run --quiet -- role-packet-check artifacts\factor-role-v1
cargo run --quiet -- bakeoff

python artifacts\factor-v1\verify_packet.py artifacts\factor-v1
python C:\src\tracker\repos\standards-protocols\roles\tools\check_roles.py .
git diff --check
```

Each implementation pulse must add focused correctness and smoke commands
before code is admitted.
