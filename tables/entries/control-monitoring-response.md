# Objective, Control, Monitoring, and Response

Status: candidate anchor entry

## Orientation

An objective states a desired result or condition. A set point is a selected
reference value for a controlled variable; an actuator converts a command into
influence on a process. Monitoring observes; indicators summarize; thresholds
classify; alerts communicate. A service-level objective binds a service-level
indicator to a target and compliance window. These are different target,
measurement, mechanism, communication, and effect layers.

## Sense table

| Sense | Governing question | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `objective` | Which desired result, state, or performance level is being pursued? | target or evaluation reference |
| `monitoring` | What subject is observed through which method, cadence, window, and quality controls? | ongoing observation process |
| `indicator` | Which defined measure or signal summarizes relevant condition or performance? | selected observable proxy |
| `threshold` | Which comparison boundary changes classification, attention, or action? | decision boundary |
| `alert` | Which significant condition is communicated to whom, at what priority, with what expected response? | routed notification |
| `feedback-control` | How does observed state influence action intended to affect future state relative to an objective? | closed-loop influence |
| `governance-control` | Which safeguard, countermeasure, process, policy, or practice modifies risk or supports a requirement? | governed risk/requirement treatment |
| `feedback` | How do effects return to influence causes or future activity? | reinforcing or balancing loop relation |
| `intervention` | Which deliberate action changes the subject, process, or environment? | applied response |
| `outcome` | Which intended or unintended effect resulted over the selected horizon? | resulting effect |
| `set-point` | What reference value or schedule should this controlled variable follow under the current operating mode? | control-loop reference input |
| `actuator` | Which mechanism accepts a command and converts it into physical or logical action on the selected process? | command-to-process influence mechanism |
| `service-level-objective` | What target or range must a declared service-level indicator meet for an eligible population over a compliance window? | scoped service-performance objective |

| Objective vs. set point | a set point may operationalize an objective | broad desired result vs. reference for one controlled variable and mode |
| Set point vs. threshold | both may be comparison values | reference the loop seeks to track vs. boundary that classifies or triggers action |
| Set point vs. observed value | both use the controlled variable's unit | selected reference vs. measured or estimated state |
| Controller vs. actuator | both participate in control | computes/selects command vs. converts command into process influence |
| Actuator vs. intervention | an actuator may execute an intervention | persistent mechanism role vs. particular action applied in context |
| Indicator vs. service-level objective | an SLO is measured through an indicator | defined service measure vs. target plus comparison window |
| SLO vs. achieved service level | both may use the same percentage | desired target vs. observed aggregate |
| SLO vs. service-level agreement | an agreement may contain an SLO | operational objective vs. commitment with parties, authority, and consequences |
| SLO vs. user outcome | SLOs should reflect user-relevant behavior | scoped service proxy/target vs. broader experienced effect |

## Diagnostic examples

- A dashboard displays indicators but does not control the service.
- A CPU-temperature threshold can trigger an alert, while a fan controller
  independently performs feedback control.
- A security policy and multifactor-authentication mechanism are governance
  controls; they are not feedback control loops merely because metrics exist.
- An alert with no recipient or expected response is only a detected
  condition or log event.
- A corrective intervention can create reinforcing side effects elsewhere.
- Meeting an activity target does not prove the desired outcome occurred.
- A temperature objective can produce different set points by operating mode;
  changing the set point does not prove the process reached or stabilized at it.
- A controller can issue the correct command while a saturated, delayed,
  disconnected, or failed actuator produces little process change.
- A service can meet an average-latency SLO while a user segment experiences
  severe tail latency excluded or hidden by the indicator definition.
- Missing an internal SLO is not automatically breach of an agreement, and
  meeting it does not prove every user outcome or contractual obligation.

## Specialized view

The linked
[Control and Response Failure Diagnostic](../diagnostics/control-response-failures.md)
maps observed monitoring and response symptoms to candidate causes and
discriminating tests.

## Selection procedure

1. State the subject, boundary, stakeholders, objective, and time horizon.
2. Separate direct observations from derived indicators.
3. Define each indicator's numerator/denominator or model, unit/scale, window,
   freshness, quality, and owner.
4. Define thresholds with basis, operator, window, persistence, hysteresis,
   missing-data behavior, and reset semantics.
5. Define alerts with recipient, priority, routing, deduplication, context,
   acknowledgment, escalation, and expected response.
6. Select feedback control only when observed state influences action that
   affects future state; record set point/objective, loop path, delay, sign,
   authority, and stability assumptions.
7. Select governance control for safeguards or countermeasures; record
   requirement/risk, owner, implementation, evidence, effectiveness test, and
   residual exposure.
8. Record interventions separately from decisions, alerts, and outcomes.
9. Measure intended and unintended outcomes over a declared horizon and
   baseline or comparison.
10. Revise indicators, thresholds, controls, and interventions from observed
    failure, drift, and feedback.
11. For a set point, declare controlled variable, unit, reference source,
    schedule, mode, bounds, ramping, tolerance, and change authority.
12. For an actuator, declare command/interface, manipulated variable, range,
    saturation, rate limits, delay, dynamics, feedback, failure modes, manual
    override, and safe-state ownership.
13. For an SLO, declare service and user boundary, SLI specification and
    implementation, eligible events, numerator/denominator or statistic,
    threshold, target, compliance window, exclusions, missingness, error-budget
    policy, owner, revision, and relation to any agreement.

## Reference Delta

| Reference form | Typical contribution | Factorium delta |
|---|---|---|
| Dictionary | Defines objective, monitor, indicator, threshold, alert, control, feedback, intervention, and outcome | Separates observation, decision, communication, action, and effect |
| Thesaurus | Links metric, alarm, safeguard, response, correction, and result | Prevents related operational words from becoming interchangeable |
| Encyclopedia or control text | Explains feedback systems, monitoring, and governance controls | Places technical and governance control senses side by side without merging them |
| Dashboard or alert configuration | Implements selected indicators and rules | Requires source semantics, response ownership, and outcome review |
| Factorium | Connects evidence, decisions, constraints, diagnostics, transitions, and outcomes | Makes every stage and failure owner visible |

## Constraints and failure signs

- Objectives identify beneficiary, desired condition, measure, horizon, and
  tradeoffs.
- Monitoring states method, frequency, window, freshness, quality, and owner.
- Indicators state derivation, interpretation, and known proxy limitations.
- Thresholds state temporal and missing-data semantics.
- Alerts state recipient, priority, route, expected response, and reset.
- Monitoring is not credited as control without an influence path.
- Feedback sign, delay, authority, saturation, and side effects are visible.
- Governance controls retain requirement/risk, implementation, evidence,
  effectiveness, and residual exposure.
- Interventions are not relabeled as outcomes.
- Intended and unintended outcomes are reviewed over the declared horizon.
- Set points are not substituted for objectives, thresholds, observations, or
  evidence that the target was reached.
- Actuator existence or command acknowledgment is not evidence of process
  influence; range, saturation, dynamics, feedback, and failure state remain visible.
- An SLO retains service boundary, user population, SLI, eligible events,
  measurement point, aggregation, target, and compliance window.
- SLO target, observed service level, error budget, alert threshold, and
  contractual commitment remain separate.
- Meeting an SLO does not certify correctness, user satisfaction, safety,
  compliance, or all service outcomes.
- Named controller families, actuator types, monitoring products, and service
  commitments remain examples or scoped authorities rather than senses.
